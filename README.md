# Keras-for-Co-occurrence-Feature-Learning-from-Skeleton-Data-for-Action-Recognition

This is a Keras implemenation for [
Co-occurrence Feature Learning from Skeleton Data for Action Recognition and Detection with Hierarchical Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06055).

Only the multi person action recognition is implemented, while the detection part could be extented by this code.
Since the author has not released the original code, this implementation could miss some details, so it is just for reference.

For single object action recognition, please also see our work https://github.com/fandulu/DD-Net, which is smaller and faster.
